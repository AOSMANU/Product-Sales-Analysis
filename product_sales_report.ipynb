While this initially suggests that Call is the most efficient method, further investigation reveals nuanced factors. The Email + Call method demonstrated stronger overall performance, with evidence of higher website visits and a greater average number of items purchased per customer. It has the highest customer conversion rate of  12.2% while and Email and Call are having similar rates, 9.7% and 9.5% respectively. Additionally, the Email + Call method exhibited consistent revenue growth throughout the 6-week period. Conversely, the Call method, despite its high initial revenue, showed a decline over time."
